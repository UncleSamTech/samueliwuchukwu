My name is Samuel Iwuchukwu, but you can call me Sam. I am in the final year of my Master’s program at the University of Alberta, where I’m researching code completion in Scratch visual coding. With five years of experience in software engineering, I have developed expertise through my Master’s thesis, Bachelor’s degree, and professional roles in both large enterprises and startup environments. I have advanced technical skills in building resilient microservices architectures using C# and .NET Core and have demonstrated strong research abilities through scientific writing, data engineering, language modeling, and data science.

In addition to technical skills, I have developed strong leadership capabilities, having mentored a team of 15 software engineering students in creating a robust Android application during my program at the University of Alberta. I also presented a novel theory on how developers modify Scratch files using open coding, grounded theory, and theoretical sampling. In my research, I introduced a Ranked Bidirectional Context Model based on the BERT Model to enhance intelligence within visual coding environments.
